+  Iâ€™m @srtoxyc.
*
*  I'm a beginner programmer who is learning C++ and Java at the moment.
*  Pretty interested in programming in general, but mostly in backend, databases and also in visual applications,
*  but I don't have the resources and knowledge yet to start with all of that.
*
*  I've also worked a little bit with HTML and CSS, but just experienced with the most basic stuff.
*
*  I hope to learn and share my knowledge here someday, when I feel prepared to.
*  Thank you for reading this!
